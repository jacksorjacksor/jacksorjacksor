      <h2>Transcript</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! So this week I have put together a portfolio website for my Dad
        who is an artist, and deserved to have a nice portfolio website but I
        couldn't sort that out so I made one instead!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the first portfolio website I have ever tried to put together so
        I thought it would be a really interesting process to first of all do
        and then to make a video kind of talking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But to begin I would like to share with you a 60 second explanation of
        how the internet works and how websites actually work in terms of what
        we see from our browser and I had a few little friends to help me and
        this is dedicated to my wonderful niece, who is great!
      </p>
      <p>
        OK! What we first of all have to know is that a website is just a set of
        files held on a computer called a server When our computer searches for
        a website like "malcolmjackson.art" what's actually going on is that the
        computer sends a message to the server asking to get a copy of those
        files and the server then sends back those files and that's what we see
        when we see a website.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, we don't necessarily know where the server is so we need a
        third computer which is called a DNS server and so that is an address
        book for the internet and tells us where all the websites are in the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what happens when we look for a website is our computer first of all
        asks the DNS server where we can find it, the DNS server tells us, and
        then we follow those instructions to get to the server, which is where
        we've sent our message saying "please can we see this website" and it
        goes "yes, of course", and sends us back those files So this whole video
        is going to be a "high level explanation" so it's going to be very
        basic, it's not talking about the "low level", exact processes This is
        also not an expert tutorial because I am not an expert This is just
        based on my own experiences I in no way pretend that it's anything more
        than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you're interested I'd like to talk you through what went into
        making this site.
      </p>
      <p>So!</p>
      <p>
        To begin with I'm just going to talk you through the programs and the
        actual websites I needed to use to make this site. and then just give
        you a rough overview of the entire process it's, generally, it was
        really interesting for me to put together as a first project and I think
        it's very worth checking out.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to begin with The programs and the websites; I'd like to split them
        into two categories of creation and of deployment So creation is just
        like the programs used to make the site to code it, the images used etc.
        and then deployment is actually getting it onto the internet so as per
        the previous explanation- actually putting those files onto the server
        registering it with the DNS server, etc, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK! So, in terms of those programs or websites that I used for making it
        so the "creation" side of things, the vast, vast majority of the code is
        based on a Brad Traversy, of Traversy Media, YouTube video called
        "Creative Agency Website From Scratch | HTML & CSS" I will put a link in
        the description it's a very good video and Traversy does a fantastic job
        of explaining things perfectly for the level I am currently at and I
        would strongly recommend his videos for anyone well I mean I think they
        cover all ability ranges but this specific one was good for beginners to
        intermediates which is kind of where I place myself at present.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code editor I used actually writing the code was VS [Visual Studio]
        Code Editor it's free, it's great, check it out. Because this website
        was going to be a static website which essentially just means that it is
        just a few files, it doesn't do anything clever with the server It's a
        little bit confusing but just bear with me that it's just a very, very
        basic website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making a contact form which actually sends emails was remarkably
        difficult but luckily there was a service called FormSubmit.co which
        I've been using for this particular site and that works perfectly for
        right now and is, again, free. So that's really, really useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The one thing I did actually spend money on was the lightbox effect, so
        that's actually what displays the portfolio images, because I purchased
        the premium version of fslightbox While lightboxes aren't the hardest
        things to make and you just need an amount of Javascript knowledge
        because this was my first portfolio site and because it was
        predominantly art-based and, you know, visual I really wanted to do the
        best job I possibly could do with the portfolio side of things so
        instead of trying to cobble together my own lightbox for an actual
        client I just purchased it, and that also means I've got that for future
        which is useful you know, I think you can gather resources to use on
        different projects as you go along but in future I could well make my
        own I don't think it's that difficult from what I've heard but again I'm
        not an authority so I don't know conclusively.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then all the actual assets were provided by the client in this case,
        my Dad. So he first of all approved the fact that I was going to use the
        Traversy Media "Creative Agency Website From Scratch" tutorial and, you
        know, that format and layout he was very happy because that meant there
        was a demo that I could send to him as the client of that fully working
        website and I just said "we're going to be emulating this" and that
        meant that he had something you know, that he could explore and play
        around with, which was great You know, and so he then provided, the
        client I should say, in this case my Dad the client provided all the
        text, all the images I would then request if the images were too large,
        which they were to begin with, that they be made smaller both in
        dimensions and also in file size and then if they could be compressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based upon how the lightbox I was using works I also needed separate
        thumbnail images which incidentally all had to be square so again I
        asked the client to provide all of those so that they would be exactly
        the squares that he wanted which worked really, really well and was
        really useful for the client to learn how to do these things as well
        ...and, yeah.... and that was kind of that, so those are the vast
        majority of things used in the "creation" side of the site
      </p>
      <p>
        So for the "deployment" all of the code itself in terms of version
        control and you know in terms of actually like maintaining it and making
        sure that we can keep a log of what's changed etc. was hosted through
        GitHub, that is again free the server, so the actual place which holds
        the files which will hold the website's files was held through
        Netlify.com, and that was for free and the domain name was purchased
        through a service called NameCheap.com so NameCheap.com allow you to
        purchase domain names which will then be registered by the DNS server as
        per the earlier explanation so you need to purchase, in our case
        "malcolmjackson.art" or for me personally "jacksorjacksor.xyz" NameCheap
        are, as per their name, very cheap it was about, what, £7, £5 per year
        or something like that it was really quite minimal but if you didn't
        want to spend any money at all both Netlify and GitHub both provide free
        services to host your pages
      </p>
      <p>
        So for example Netlify, I believe would mean that your website can be
        accessed through malcolmjacksonart.netlify.app and [for GitHub, you can
        set this up but I didn't so am not sure what the URL for that would be.]
      </p>
      <p>
        So there are free ways you can do that but we decided to purchase the
        domain name because, you know, it's fun, and NameCheap has some really
        nice, you know, domains like .art or .xyz you know, those are just quite
        nice That's essentially it - we had the design we agreed on the design I
        went away and coded it
      </p>
      <p>
        I then asked for the assets to be sent over, they were there was
        iteration, there were things that were changed, formats, layouts, etc.
        but you know that's fairly standard and then we deployed it and it is
        now live and on the internet and now he has a portfolio website and I
        have my first release. So yeah, I thought it was really, really good fun
        and I very much enjoyed it and I think now for me personally
      </p>
      <p>
        I would just like to improve my abilities to make these kind of sites
        you know, this is a very, very basic one it's what's referred to as a
        static one so it doesn't have a framework so it doesn't have any
        server-side processes which is slightly out of scope for this video
      </p>
      <p>
        I mean talking about scope, one of the important things talking about
        client and developer relations was just about when to be able to tell
        your clients that their requests are out of scope and that's a very
        important thing to setup, and, you know, scope and creep and making sure
        that what you're actually doing is related to the project you're hired
        for is very, very important or you know they might turn around and go
        like "you know this one thing doesn't work in the particular way" and
        you just have to turn around to the client and go like "that is out of
        scope for this current project" and luckily I had a good relationship
        with my client in this instance but yeah that's something that can
        definitely catch people out in any project ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wanted to do a quick video just explaining that please do check out
        the site: "malcolmjackson.art" his artwork is wonderful do let me know
        what you think of the site as a whole
      </p>
      <p>
        I really like it and I had a great time working on it so let me know
        what you think and I will see you soon.
      </p>
      <p>Take care, bye.</p>
