        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>
          Recently I've taken a bit of a break from music making and the videos
          I've been making on a weekly basis have been about slightly different
          things like video game audio, myself which has an *laughs* interesting
          experience. And, you know, explaining how the internet works with
          koroks so, you know, swings and roundabouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also been ill for the past week so it's been really fun. But I
          decided that this week I wanted to put together something musical and
          so I figured I'd have a little sing-song.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, about three weeks ago I had a pretty long, emotional car journey
          to make in a car with a broken stereo and so I decided... well I
          didn't even decide, it just happened I just ended up singing, a lot,
          pretty much constantly pretty much the whole way, at least there (not
          so much on the way back) and basically, I ended up, for whatever
          reason, singing songs by dodie.
        </p>
        <p>
          dodie is a fantastic singer-songwriter and has recently released and
          album called "Build A Problem" which is superb and you should go check
          that out immediately and one of the things that she's known for is the
          fact that around Christmas time she'll typically record Christmas
          songs in minor keys, so pretty much literally flipping positives into
          negatives in a musical sense at the very least.
        </p>
        <p>
          And with that in mind, somewhere in the back of my head, I started
          singing dodie songs and then flipping them into minor keys so I
          figured I'd record one. So here's dodie, dodie's song "Cool Girl" from
          her album "Build A Problem".
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh yeah, and because it's dodie I had to put it in 6/8 because...
          them's the rules.
        </p>

              ># sings "Cool Girl" by dodie, arranged for three-part a cappella
              voices and in a minor key #</em
            >
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the fun things about social media is knowing really specific
          things about people you haven't met and feeling kind of bad about
          knowing them somehow, like, you know, I shouldn't really know these
          things but the person told me, they broadcast it but it still feels a
          bit weird an parasocial.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one of things I do know is that dodie lives with two incredibly
          talented singer-songwriters Greta Isaac and Martin Luke Brown. Greta's
          an incredible singer-songwriter, she's fantastic I have a particular
          love for her song "Comfortable" which I think is brilliant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, she's recently released an EP called "Pessimist" and I
          figured, you know, if I've done a dodie song might as well do a Greta
          song as well! So for this arrangement I specifically went with some
          slightly stranger chords than I would normally use as a dedication to
          her for recommending on some interviews about the joys of Chris Thile
          and Nickel Creek and the album "Why Should The Fire Die" and the song
          "Eveline".
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah this is my dedication to that song and for her for
          recommending it 'cause it's an incredible record in general. So here
          is, off Greta Isaac's EP "Pessimist" the song "Like Me".
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Now it's time for the third and final housemate, Martin Luke Brown,
          who I know so little about! But what I do know is that anything he's
          involved with is great It looks like he's taking a bit of a break from
          his own projects and is instead focusing on song-writing and
          production for other people and his Spotify playlist of credits is
          pretty ridiculous so do check it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway he's great, any project he's involved with is great, and he
          writes wonderful songs as well and here is one of his songs in a minor
          key this is his song "J.O.Y." - "Joy" - hope you enjoy!
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          So there you go, hope you've enjoyed if you like what I've done with
          these people's songs then please check out a few of mine! You can
          check out my EP from last year "Normalised" at
          jacksorjacksor.bandcamp.com, you can find my actual EP of
          singer-songwriter songs from last year and then my album of digital
          contemporary orchestral stuff which I love so much! Like it was such
          an odd project to do but I've got such a soft spot for it. So if
          you've enjoyed please do consider checking them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But I figured I'd finish this off with doing a bit of a medley of
          songs by all the three housemates essentially so here is a medley of
          songs by dodie, Greta Isaac and Martin Luke Brown.
