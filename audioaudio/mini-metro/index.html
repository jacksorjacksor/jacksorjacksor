        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome.</p>
        <p>
          So, today's episode's going to be a touch more rushed than the
          previous one on "A Monster's Expedition", we're going to be talking
          about "Mini Metro" and its incredible procedurally-generated
          soundtrack by Richard Vreeland aka "Disasterpiece" who's known
          obviously for things like "Fez" and "Hyperlight Drifter" and the
          wonderful film soundtrack for "It Follows".
        </p>
        <p>
          So the reason I particularly wanted to take a look at this game is
          because it is currently part of the "Indie Bundle for Palestinian Aid"
          available on Itch.io which at the time of recording is only available
          for the ridiculously low price of $5 which includes this and 1018
          other games and is only available for the next 4 days and 20 hours so
          I figured this'd be a... well, this is the only time I've got to do it
          so I figured I'd at least put something together to support this
          incredible bundle, to support this incredible game and if you happen
          to pick up the bundle then one of my games "Click Miner" is also in
          that so yay for that kind of publicity, but more importantly, "Mini
          Metro" and its fantastic audio.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little addition; I actually have my Arturia Microfreak to help me
          out because there are lots of notes and I'm going to need to know what
          they are and my pitching is not the best and "Mini Metro's" entire
          soundtrack is generated procedurally and that means that it's going to
          be created by the program, by the game itself
        </p>
        <p>
          So things within the game's code are going to be generating the sound
          and that gives us a huge amount of flexibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          So previously on the last episode we talking about "A Monster's
          Expedition" and how it uses vertical and horizontal audio and
          procedural audio essentially can be used in either of those categories
          and the way that this is going to be used, sorry, that it's going to
          be used for particular game is building up these layers but entirely
          through the logic (which has been pre-defined) but this game could
          actually be, the music for it is actually going to be in any key that
          it wants to be in but it'll typically stick in one key per level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Richard Vreeland has actually made a behind the scenes video which is
          an hour and a half but to give you an impression of how rushed I am to
          do this I haven't actually been able to watch it yet, so please do
          watch it 'cos I'm... please do watch it because I'm sure it's very,
          very worth your time, everything *laughs* any video I've ever watched
          of him is worth its weight in gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          OK cool cool, so without further ado let's get on to the actual
          playing of "Mini Metro", a game where we are just trying to get
          passengers from one place to another with trains, OK!
        </p>
        <p>
          So a couple of really nice things to notice while we just listen...
        </p>
        <p>OK so we've got that low kick drum</p>
        <p>
          The entire... all of the music here is in B flat major... he says
          *laughs*
        </p>
        <p>
          Apologies, that was a hilarious garble just because of the keyboard,
          but B flat major
        </p>
        <p>So Bb, D, F</p>
        <p>
          Every single time you load the game it'll be in a different key so I
          have to check every single time
        </p>
        <p>
          As a little kind of design thing I love that we have audio options for
          audio "Full"... "Minimal"... and actually for "Silent".
        </p>
        <p>
          I also really, really like the way that they just, the notes just
          trail... have that nice release envelope at the end of them. I'm not
          entirely sure on the difference between "Silent" and "Minimal" but
          we'll of course be playing with "Full" and with volume at medium.
        </p>
        <p>Let's just have a little go, so...</p>
        <p>It's just such a lovely sound world for this game</p>
        <p>
          So we're just going to be playing through one level, we're going to be
          playing through "London"
        </p>
        <p>*singing*</p>
        <p>Yeah, so again, nice chords</p>
        <p>
          Alright, so now we're actually starting in London and we can actually
          pause the game which is nice to be aware of
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the way, just to give you a quick rundown of the mechanics, we are
          going to be able to join up trainlines together... as so.
        </p>
        <p>Now you might have already noticed something quite interesting.</p>
        <p>Each of... well I was probably talking over it.</p>
        <p>
          Each of these trainlines of which we start off with the option of
          using three of them, the yellow line, the red line and the blue line,
          each of them is assigned a different note.
        </p>
        <p>*sings*</p>
        <p>
          OK so we're in D major, ok, fabulous, so we're in D major for this
          particular level, OK!
        </p>
        <p>
          And if we, if I do that again and you listen out to those notes, so
          yellow has that low A of more precisely... *sings* that's the F#, so
          that's the third of the chord *sings* and that's the root of the
          chord, the D.
        </p>
        <p>
          And those are referred to as&nbsp; "Chord Tones", the first, third and
          fifth of the chord
        </p>
        <p>
          And when we start, and I know that looks ridiculous so let's just play
          for a little bit
        </p>
        <p>Cool, OK, great.</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, so what we've now done, I mean in terms of the game we've
          created three trainlines but you'll hear that each of those trainlines
          has that nice resonant "hum" going on in, you know, in it and it's
          just this really lovely way that the soundtrack is building from the
          objects, so for example if I got rid of, say, the yellow line...
        </p>
        <p>
          We no longer have that bass note, the root note, sorry, I'm actually
          wrong, sorry, I got rid of the A so we've just got a D and an F sharp,
          you know, and so the soundtrack is being created by the
        </p>
        <p>
          objects which are present so I'll bring it back so I've got the full
          chord.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's nice to start with a second inversion chord, so we've got an A in
          the bass, so we've got A D F#
        </p>
        <p>
          because it's just a nice little touch to bring a sense of instability.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you'll just hear... ah and that really low D, really, really great
          to hear.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what's so lovely is that as I'm interacting with these trainlines,
          if I'm clicking on them and dragging them it will remember what note
          is associated, so that's going to be&hellip;
        </p>
        <p>
          This one's going to be the D note, this one's the low A, that'll be
          the F#, you know that kind of thing
        </p>
        <p>
          And so yeah just the way that the soundtrack is so embedded into the
          object is so lovely
        </p>
        <p>
          And like I said it could be in a number of different keys, I don't
          know if it's all 12 but at least a handful of different keys it could
          be each time.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what's going on in terms of gameplay is that these stations are
          generating shapes
        </p>
        <p>
          So this, and these shapes need to go to their correct station, so all
          circles need to go to circles, if there was a square that'd have to go
          to a square and if it was a triangle...
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah if this triangle you can possibly see here, it's black on very
          dark blue has to go over to there and they're taken by the carriages,
          I think there was a point but I just wanted to quickly finish...
        </p>
        <p>
          oh, everytime I pause and unpause there's a little bit of a ticking
          sound, that's just from the clock.
        </p>
        <p>Also showing us that we've got a steady pulse throughout</p>
        <p>Low D</p>
        <p>
          So again we're just playing around with the chord tones, the first,
          third and fifth degrees of that scale
        </p>
        <p>
          So this is, in terms of people who learn about harmony, like, the kind
          of, the basics that you have.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is, this is setting up our root tonality, what "home" feels like.
        </p>
        <p>And we'll just keep going</p>
        <p>Again, nice low D</p>
        <p>
          So we're actually going to speed it up, we're going to hit the fast
          forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          So isn't it just lovely, this kind of, this haze of sound that's
          created
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually there will other notes, it's interesting to me that...
          *sings*
        </p>
        <p>
          Ah cool, fantastic, just toward the end there we got that C# and then
          the F#
        </p>
        <p>
          So those two notes were added there, which kind of gives us this sense
          of minor tonality, we're now into week 2 and the harmony starts
          shifting, it starts changing up somewhat
        </p>
        <p>
          We are still in the D major scale, it's just going to be treating
          those notes and giving those notes different weighting to give us
          different chordal colours, and if I just like stop talking you know
          it's just these lovely rhythms, and if you remember our like pulse was
          going like *clicks in time* you get this real sense that the whole
          game (or like more precisely it was more like that *clicks at half
          speed* wasn't it)
        </p>
        <p>
          From when we hit pause on the clock or when we unpaused the clock, we
          heard that it's lovely how the entire game runs on this metronome,
          it's just sort of in the background, there isn't, you know, you can
          feel that pulse
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, we've got a new locomotive, and we'll going to take another
          line because that means we'll get another note to play with and that's
          what we're here for.
        </p>
        <p>*sings*</p>
        <p>
          Cool, and then we actually have, I'm going to pause it there, and then
          now we actually have this F#m7, this F# A C# E and that's just a
          really love... and...&nbsp; again... *laughs*
        </p>
        <p>Every time I talk I want to just listen</p>
        <p>
          Yeah, and again, it's more colouration from the fact that we started
          on the D... yeah...
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah I'm right, 'cos we started in, you know, with the D major as
          being our key and now we've got the F#m7
        </p>
        <p>
          Again we're still in the scale, so everything 'works' harmonically
          because it's all diatonic, that is the word for the day, it means it
          fits in the scale but it just means that everything is able to gel
          harmonically and it'll "work" which lends itself to procedural music
          in general.
        </p>
        <p>Let's just go.</p>
        <p>*sings* and now having just had that touch of F# minor we now...</p>
        <p>
          Oh that was a low A so again, because A is chord V of D major it still
          means that the notes of A major will work again it's just playing
          around with diatonic harmony in a procedural environment *clicks*
          those are ridiculous words.
        </p>
        <p>*sings* is that really... yeah that's a low A</p>
        <p>*sings*</p>
        <p>Lovely F sharps</p>
        <p>
          Just hearing... oh yeah, of course, sorry, I'm being an idiot, we have
          an entirely new trainline to add so I'm going to add it from...
        </p>
        <p>*sings* ...that's the A, my apologies</p>
        <p>
          Sorry, I'm actually just thinking about the game which is not what
          we're here for
        </p>
        <p>
          *sings* we keep hearing baby shark, but hopefully we won't get a
          copyright thing for that he says, very very hopefully
        </p>
        <p>
          That'd be ridiculous if I got a copyright strike for that, but
          stranger things have happened!
        </p>
        <p>*sings*</p>
        <p>
          OK, and this is essentially the majority of how this soundscape works,
          so what's going to happen now is that I'm going to wait 'til the end
          of the week just because more stuff will happen *sings* low D
        </p>
        <p>Whoops</p>
        <p>
          Even like the UI sounds are all tuned in, like when I picked up...
          *sings* like that's, that's an E so that fits in the scale
        </p>
        <p>I literally can't grab any other</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>*sings* so again, all of the sounds are tuned to the home key.</p>
        <p>This is such a lovely example of how the UI can build up.</p>
        <p>Alright so this is interesting, so...</p>
        <p>
          The final mechanic of this game, as we are in week 3, is that when
          trains, I'll just...
        </p>
        <p>*sings* beautiful C# against the D there.</p>
        <p>Anyway *sings* Oh yeah it's kind of an A C# D kind of thing</p>
        <p>
          Yeah so what's going to happen now is that this station has too many
          people and so we need to make sure our trains are prepared to deal
          with that and the way the game creates tension in these scenarios is
          to add percussion, and that's essentially what we get now and then
          notice we get that&nbsp; *ticking sound* but now because the
          passengers were taken away and the station was back to its normal
          capacity the... that then faded out again, so again the layer of that
          percussion fading in and out depending on the severity of how we are
          at the minute, of where we are as the player so you'll hear it back in
          and out.
        </p>
        <p>What we're going to do is try and sabotage ourselves - yes, cool!</p>
        <p>
          No! I was scuttled [?? think I meant "scuppered"] by this red dude, so
          let's get the red people out of the way and we're just going to try
          and overflow
        </p>
        <p>Yeah, by now we're just trying to lose.</p>
        <p>
          So we're trying to overflow this - I'm actually going to turn it back
          to normal speed, just so you can hear the percussion build up.
        </p>
        <p>So lovely, finishing on that B.</p>
        <p>And you know, and still B being note vi of D major</p>
        <p>
          And that's a really, really cool and interesting way to create drama
          is just to add those little extra bits of percussion, have the
          complaining people.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're playing it on fast forward then yeah that's in double time
          as well so that's even more dramatic and I realised half way through
          that that might have been interesting so go check it out!
        </p>
        <p>
          But yeah it's just, there is just so much imagination in that and
          again it just suits the game so perfectly
        </p>
        <p>
          So that is going to be the end of what we're going to be taking a look
          at
        </p>
        <p>So...</p>
        <p>
          OK so now we're in E major for example and we certainly weren't
          before, we were in B flat I think? Yeah.
        </p>
        <p>
          So this has been "Mini Metro", I'm just going to mute this as I finish
          off
        </p>
        <p>
          Such a lovely touch the way that it doesn't just mute immediately but
          it actually just fades with its release tails.
        </p>
        <p>Yeah so, (let's go to here... yeah)</p>
        <p>
          So this has been a very, very quick video, and not very well prepared,
          on "Mini Metro" and looking at procedural audio
        </p>
        <p>
          Like I said, the reason I did it in a bit of rush is that in 4 hours
          and 20... sorry, in 4 days and 20 hours the "Indie Bundle for
          Palestinian Aid" will no longer be available so if you want to pick
          this game up, one of my games up, and 1017 other games for $5 then go
          to itch.io and look into the "Indie Bundle for Palestinian Aid" I
          think it is a great cause and I think it is worth looking into.

          So, "Mini Metro", music by Richard Vreeland, incredible, fascinating
          procedural audio
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have the time, which I haven't, then please watch his hour and
          a half video talking about how he made it, I will put a link in the
          bio [I meant "description"]
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm sure he'll say lots of things and disprove pretty much everything
          I've said but that's by the by.
        </p>
        <p>
          So yeah, like I said I'm going to aim to do one of these every month
          but due to the shortness of availability on the indie bundle I figured
          I would just do one immediately
        </p>
        <p>
          So I hope you're having a great day, hope you've enjoyed, if you've
          got any thoughts, if you've got any ideas of things that you'd like to
          ask me or games that you think I should check out then let me know -
          I'm always really really appreciative of your time and thoughts
        </p>
        <p>
          So I hope you have yourselves a great, great day and take care of
          yourselves - bye!
