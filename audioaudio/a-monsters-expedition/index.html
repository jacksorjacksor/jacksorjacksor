        <p>
          Hello and welcome to episode 1 in a new series I'm putting together
          called "audioaudio" which is just where I look at some game sounds and
          music and... talk about them, because there are some really amazing
          things going on and I figured it'd be a nice way for me to be able to
          explain some concepts which I find are absolutely amazing
        </p>
        <p>
          And I figured I'd start with talking about a puzzle game I've very
          much enjoyed recently, "A Monster's Expedition Through Puzzling
          Exhibitions" by Draknek and friends who we can see right here and a
          special shout has to go to Eli Rainsberry who is responsible for the
          audio of this game and I think they've done an absolutely incredible
          job.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, what I wanted to talk about was the use of responsive audio in
          this game and to quickly go through definitions I figured I'd quickly
          talk about the difference between "Horizontal" and "Vertical" audio
          when we talk about adaptive design.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, typically when we approach music which is cued by a player's
          interaction which is what "Adaptive Music" is that we either have
          blocks of sound which could be played at random depending on what the
          player does, so that's referred to as "horizonal" because you're kind
          of building your blocks as you go, or you have "vertical" which is
          where we have layers of music and the player's location or
          interactions or anything like that cues what combination of things are
          done.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for example you might start off in a very relaxed state and there
          would only be one layer of music playing, like a flute, and then later
          on as you get more intense that flautist could be joined by, you know,
          drums, bass, kazoo and djembe and the vuvuzela casually chilling out
          in the background as well for the extra drama.
        </p>
        <p>
          And so that would referred to as "vertical" sound and I think this
          game, "A Monster's Expedition", does such a lovely job of combining
          elements of both of those ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the idea for today is that we're going to be just playing through
          the opening of this game there's an opening credits sequence that
          happens about 5 minute in so we're going to playing up 'til then and I
          think that's a great representation of how audio's presented through
          this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, for anyone who's interested, this game is made in Unity
          and the audio is implemented through FMOD middleware but I'm not
          really going to go into more of the specifics, this is more about the
          user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          So without further ado we're going to be starting off with a new game
          and I'll just be playing bits and pieces as we go and talking about
          them so let's go!
        </p>
        <p>
          Cool, so right of the bat, one of the things that I really love is how
          the sound really hasn't changed from the opening credits into the very
          opening of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing that happens is the sound of the tug boat coming in,
          then leaving, and then we are as we are, so from then on the only
          addition is the fact that as we're moving we can hear the lovely
          grass, and that's that and we can still hear that constantly beautiful
          seashore, lapping kind of sound there which we're actually going to
          mute now for the rest of, well for at least the majority of the
          playthrough because I want you to hear other things also... Hello to
          our wonderful player there! "Hello!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alright, so what we're going to do is just get rid of the ambience
          because we really want to focus on the music and the sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          OK, so what's going to happen now is we are going to push this log
          over and when we do that will start a block of music this will start
          one long track going and that's going to introduce the soundworld of
          this particular game and as I'm playing I invite you to listen, I
          invite you to recognise what's going on, you know, and if you don't
          want any spoilers, close your eyes because it's a puzzle game and I
          won't be saying any of the answers out loud, so, we're going to go and
          let's have a shot.
        </p>
        <p>Beautiful.</p>
        <p>
          So finding a new area brings us that kind of, you know, cloud,
          [inhales] gasp, it's a wonderful sound there. Pushing over a log, just
          [makes "log being pushed" noise].
        </p>
        <p>
          Gradually we'll notice that that music in the background is growing;
          that *could* be vertical layering, so it could be adding more sounds
          as we are progressing further but in actuality that is just the track
          itself, so in this case I could just be stood at the very beginning
          and it would play for its entirety, but this is something that people
          do use and I do particularly like how this works because as you
          solving the puzzles it's as if the world is kind of expanding around
          you.
        </p>
        <p>It's gorgeous.</p>
        <p>
          And the instrumentation is lovely as well, so we've got that guitar,
          bass, piano, really relaxed drums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quick note: there are lots of these exhibits and we're going to be
          ignoring all of them for the sake of this for spoilers and also to
          inspire you to go and check them out because they're all hilarious so
          do check this out.
        </p>
        <p>
          So... we now get to a point where that opening track has finished and
          what we're left with is a low drone which is a D [*it's actually an
          Ab] for anyone who cares, and what's really great is that from this
          moment in time the game's approach to audio changes somewhat and we
          have a layer of audio pretty much on top of all the sound effects that
          we've just had and this is where things get really special for me. So
          let's take a listen to what before was just us pushing a log and is
          now... with the faintest little guitar part there, and let's push it
          again:
        </p>
        <p>
          And I just think it's magical, this way that from the static track
          that we had before, that finishing leading us into this drone with
          random blocks of what could be the case... you know, sorry... of
          music, musical material, such a smooth transition that I was playing
          it that I was playing it for the first time I really didn't notice
          that it had happened until about half an hour through and it was such
          a delight to realise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cool, so we're now going to push this into the water and again we're
          going to... the next thing we're going to do is to look at a new
          island
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh and as another thing there's a random bit of piano there which I'm
          pretty sure is cued from bout five pushes of the log.
        </p>
        <p>
          So again that really help... helps add a different colour, which is
          just a nice little thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          OK so we're going to be revealing a new island, so previously it was
          just a [inhales] that lovely kind of
        </p>
        <p>
          inhale/exhale of the clouds clearing but we're going to joined by
          something different now.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now that sound has the actual... has that extra piano part and
          that's just another little, nice thing and believe me, when these
          puzzles get more and more complicated towards the end, hearing that,
          knowing you've got to the next island is the most cathartic
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah, other things that we might have just noticed - the drone note
          has changed; it's no longer a D [*it was actually an Ab] and these
          kinds of things are just a lovely way that this game shows... sorry,
          the audio can support the puzzle games' attitude towards using a few
          small ingredients so, so well, you know that small shift gives this
          island a different feeling to the previous one, even though it's a
          relatively straightforward change.
        </p>
        <p>In fact I messed that up</p>
        <p>I go along to the next island</p>
        <p>Another change of the drone, which is fab</p>
        <p>
          right, and I'm just going to....do this island quickly and then I'll
          talk through the next
        </p>
        <p>bit... oh and this one as well, my apologies</p>
        <p>
          Oh yeah... OK, so, just to kind of be a bit more explicit about this
          music I'm actually going to mute the "sounds" and so we'll only be
          able to hear just those musical cues.
        </p>
        <p>
          OK so that's all muted and I won't talk while I do this little puzzle
          so you can see what it's like.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for anyone who actually knows the game that was a particularly
          bizarre way of doing, of solving that puzzle so I do apologise
        </p>
        <p>
          Right, so we're now going to just take a look at my favourite thing
          that I realised as I was playing which was that as one of the sounds,
          the undo button, because we're able to actually go back on our actions
          also has a little musical idea... and... oh, whoops, my apologies...
          there we go...
        </p>
        <p>
          Here we go, OK, so take a listen to... in fact this one doesn't really
          matter so let's keep going... OK great
        </p>
        <p>
          So when... if you get stuck on an island then you can reset an island
          and you can also go back by a move or two and what's lovely is if we
          listen out to the sound that's associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we get this beautiful little ride cymbal, and that's again that's
          such a lovely little touch that that's there going on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yeah so I'm just going to bring the... ah, yeah... yep, bring the
          music back in and just in the context of everything let's just hear
          that little bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know, and, the thing is, one of the things that's so wonderful
          about this game is that because it is... the music and the soundtrack
          is essentially created by your own actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faster you play the more frantic the soundtrack is, so especially
          when you go "oh I'm going to do this, and this, and..."
        </p>
        <p>
          you know, and you suddenly fill up the sonic space and it... so it
          just feels like... I mean it is responding to my playing in this
          really beautiful and cumulative way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I just think it's absolutely fabulous. So, what we're going to do,
          just to do the audio the credit it deserves we're going to turn back
          the ambience, the ambience there, just we can hear the beautiful
          sounds that are going on and then we've just got a few more islands to
          go through so I'm pretty much just going to play through them.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          And I'm not going to talk so that you can just listen to what the full
          game should sound like.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then this is the final island of the introductory bit, so we'll
          just solve this super quickly... he says, hopefully, and then
          immediately making a mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that is one of my favourite musical pay-offs in a game I have ever
          experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just that way that as you are playing, and as you are going through
          this soundtrack and you push off and you realise that you can push off
          because that's a whole new thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then you're just waiting there, and another track comes in, and
          then it has that beautiful crescendo
        </p>
        <p>
          And then the title screen splashes up and you're just like "I'm in a
          very special game right now"
        </p>
        <p>
          And that's how I feel about this, and what's really wonderful about
          that segment is that it reminds you, the segment of music, is that it
          reminds you that the instrumentation it has been using in both that
          and in the first track, you know, at the very opening that
          instrumentation is then used consistently throughout the game, so it
          builds up this really consistent sonic palette of instrumentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And again that really helps to build up that idea in puzzle games of
          using a few assets in the most flexible way using the most... using an
          idea in every single possible way, and you know, for a game that's
          essentially "pushing logs".
        </p>
        <p>
          I am first of all just so impressed with it as a game and second of
          all I just think the way they've approached the audio in that
          generative, simplistic yet incredibly efficient way is an absolute
          dream, and I whole heartedly recommend that everyone check it
          out.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          So, that is everything I wanted to say about the audio of this
          wonderful game, which is called " A Monster's Expedition Through
          Puzzling Exhibitions"
        </p>
        <p>
          I very, very strongly recommend that everyone goes checks it out on
          whatever device they have because you can probably find it somewhere
        </p>
        <p>
          And a huge thank you to everyone of the... I mean, sorry, everyone
          involved in making this not just for making it but for generally being
          pretty lovely when I've asked them questions or like when I've got
          stuck and obviously a huge, huge shout-out to the wonderful sound
          designer, and let's make sure that we have the name of these beautiful
          people.
        </p>
        <p>Eli Rainsberry, who's done a fantastic job on this</p>
        <p>Cool, and we'll stop there, apologies to the concept artists</p>
        <p>So...</p>
        <p>and then fades out beautifully... cool</p>
        <p>
          So I hope you have enjoyed this video - basically I just quite like
          the idea of putting together some videos where I play through bits of
          games where I think the audio is amazing and this just seemed like
          such an obvious first choice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, I hope you've enjoyed and have yourselves a most wonderful
          day, take care, bye.

          And today we're going to be taking a look at a game I have thoroughly
          enjoyed recently "A Monster's Expedition Through Puzzling Exhib..."
          *general disgruntled noises* "A Monster's Exp... A Monster's
          Expedition Through Puzzling Exhibitions, A Monster's..." "A Monster's
